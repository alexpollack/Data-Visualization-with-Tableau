## Part 2) Data Analysis
  I chose to work with the Mother Jones Shooting data set. I did so because I personally felt as though this is both an interesting and important set that can truly show the power and importance of data visulation. I went about this using the data visualization software Tableae. Initially I planned to write a Python script to visualize and compare the breakdown of the data with the different features included, as well as potentially have some prediction as to the future trends of shooting rates. I instead went with using Tableau because this set specifically more than anything shows the information breakdown of what past shootings had been like rather than how we could use that to predict where/when shootings will happen. I felt the best use of this set would be in sometime of information session or possible case toward gun reform laws and that is how I chose to format my interpretation.

### What I Learned - Data Visualization
  The reason I had said this to me was a solid example of the importance and power of data visualization was because what the result shows. The three main things shown with the presentation are: Since the 1980's the number of shootings each year has  increased dramatically while the shootings are also becoming more fatal, by a large margin most shootings are done not only by white men, but white men with evident signs of possible mental health issues, and the vast majority are semi-automatic or assault style weapons. 
  The set is very useful for showing trends and correlating the features of the event such as race of shooter, targeted venues, number of incidents over time, or total victim/fatality information. Visualizing such information provides powerful means to convey, were it the case and point of such a presentation, the need for stricter background checks to include mental health history (shown by the bar graph how most shooters in the set had some sort of sign of possible mental health issues), or the regulation or elimination of assault or semi-automatic weapons (shown by the bubble graph that a vast majority of highly fatal shootings were from legally obtained weapons of these styles).

#### How This Could be Used - Predictive Modeling
  Personally, from this dataset I do not believe much benefit from predictive analysis or modeling is present. That is because of the nature of the data. Some regression analysis could be useful in predicting the possible number of shootings or deaths likely to occur in the next year as a result of shootings. However, without extending the data to include a feature such as changes to gun law each year which could be used to interpret how possitive or negative these laws were or how further laws may do more, not much is gained from this. This is due to the fact that the data could not predict where or when necissarily the events would occur accurately, which would require more background on the shooter themselves.
